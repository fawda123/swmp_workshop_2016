The **afternoon session** will be an overview of the widgets of SWMPrats and selected time series topics.  The <a href="http://swmprats.net" target = "_parent">SWMPrats</a> website was created to assist the NERRS program with analysis and interpretation of SWMP data.  Three widgets on the website allow users to summarize trends within and between sites using a point-and-click approach.  Selected time series topics will include weighted regression for trend analysis, time series decomposition, and Seasonal Kendall tests.  

### Objectives

1) Understand the resources provided by SWMPrats
2) Learn the widgets and their assumptions
3) Familiarity with specific time series topics, why and how they are used

### 1:00pm Software set-up/help

Instructors will assist workshop attendees with **last‚Äêminute** software issues.

### 1:15pm Introduction to Widgets

Overview of <a href="http://swmprats.net" target = "_parent">SWMPrats</a> website
Overview of interactive <a href="http://swmprats.net/swmp-widgets" target = "_parent">widgets</a>

* SWMP summary plots - evaluate trends of a single parameter at a single site  
* SWMP trend maps - compare trends of a single parameter within and between reserves using a map
* SWMP aggregations - compare aggregated trends of different parameters within and between reserves
