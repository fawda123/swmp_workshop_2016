The **afternoon session** will be an overview of the widgets of SWMPrats and selected time series topics.  The [SWMPrats](http://swmprats.net/) website was created to assist the NERRS program with analysis and interpretation of SWMP data.  Three widgets on the website allow users to summarize trends within and between sites using a point-and-click approach.  Selected time series topics will include weighted regression for trend analysis, time series decomposition, and Seasonal Kendall tests.
